    "\n",
    "This notebook contains cells, i.e., snippets of either code or normal text. We use the text cells (like the current one) to explain what is going on. You can edit a cell by clicking on it. After you made the changes, you can either click 'run' above, or press shift+enter, to execute what is written. In the case of a text cell, this will just display the text in the correct format (try it with this cell!); in case of a code cell, the code will be executed. \n",

This means that once you collected tweets you should run this code at least once between 10 and 14 days later. There are 3 possible results: \n",
