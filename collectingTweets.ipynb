    "\n",
    "This notebook contains cells, i.e., snippets of either code or normal text. We use the text cells (like the current one) to explain what is going on. You can edit a cell by clicking on it. After you made the changes, you can either click 'run' above, or press shift+enter, to execute what is written. In the case of a text cell, this will just display the text in the correct format (try it with this cell!); in case of a code cell, the code will be executed. \n",

    "The next cell will be a code cell where we ask the computer to print a simple sentence for us. Try to change this sentence and then execute the code. \n"
